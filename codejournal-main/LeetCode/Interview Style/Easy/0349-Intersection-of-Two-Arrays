# LeetCode 349 — Intersection of Two Arrays
# Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays/
#
# Approach:
# 1. Convert nums1 and nums2 to sets to remove duplicates.
# 2. Use set intersection (&) to get the common elements.
# 3. Convert the result back into a list and return it.
#
# Time Complexity: O(n + m) — creating two sets and intersecting them.
# Space Complexity: O(n + m) — storing both sets in memory.
#
# Reflection:
# - This was straightforward once I remembered that set operations are O(1) on average.
# - Useful pattern: whenever I need unique common elements, think of sets first.

class Solution(object):
    def intersection(self, nums1, nums2):
        return list(set(nums1) & set(nums2))
