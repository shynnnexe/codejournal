# 📚 Code Journal

> _"Code. Learn. Iterate. Grow."_

A personal log of problem-solving practice, algorithm notes, and solutions — focused on building skill and speed through consistent coding.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This journal tracks my progress through LeetCode and other coding challenges.  
Each entry captures:
- The problem statement and constraints  
- My thought process and approach  
- Challenges, mistakes, and breakthroughs  
- Final solution and possible improvements  

---

## 📖 Entry Structure

Each diary entry follows a consistent format designed for maximum learning value:

```java
// DATE

/*
PROBLEM:
[Brief problem statement & constraints]
*/

/*
THOUGHT PROCESS:
- Initial ideas and approach
- Challenges or dead ends
- Breakthrough moments
- Complexity considerations
*/

/*
REFLECTION:
- What worked well
- What could be improved
- Edge cases to revisit
*/

[SOLUTION CODE]

## 🔗 Connect & Collaborate

Feedback Welcome!

This diary thrives on community input and collaborative learning:

💡 Suggest optimizations for existing solutions
🤔 Share alternative approaches to problems
🐛 Point out edge cases I might have missed
📚 Recommend related problems for deeper understanding
🎯 Provide interview tips or related insights

## Discussion Topics

Algorithm optimization strategies
Problem-solving methodologies
Code readability best practices
Interview preparation insights
Industry application of algorithms
Latest algorithmic research

## 📅 Practice Goals

Daily — Solve at least 1 problem
Weekly — Review patterns and common mistakes
Monthly — Set skill targets and attempt harder problems
Quarterly — Assess overall progress

## 🏆 Milestones

- [ ] First 50 problems solved
- [ ] First medium difficulty problem
- [ ] First hard difficulty problem
- [ ] 100-day streak
- [ ] Contest participation

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Browse entries by date or problem type
2. Follow the thought process in observations
3. Analyze the solutions and feedback sections
4. Try alternative approaches to the same problems
5. Share your insights and suggestions
6. Use entries as interview preparation

I’m always open to:
- Discussing different solutions to the same problem  
- Exploring alternative approaches and optimisations  
- Pair programming or collaborating on challenges  
- General coding chats and sharing resources  

Happy coding! 🚀
